# ðŸ§  Learning Loogbok â€“ My Dev Journey

Welcome to my personal knowledge log! This repository is where I collect short notes, reflections, formatting tricks, 
and practical things Iâ€™ve learned along the way as I study programming, Markdown, GitHub, and more.

It's like my digital notebook: a place to keep things I want to remember or revisit.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

- âœ… Markdown formatting tips (`markdown-cheatsheet.md`)
- âœ… GitHub basics and daily usage guide (`github-usage.md`)
- âœ… Python syntax reminders or logic patterns (`python-notes.md`)
- âœ… Learning logs from books and courses (`bitacora-2025.md`)
- âœ… Mistakes Iâ€™ve made and how I solved them (`troubleshooting.md`)
- âœ… Commands I forget often (`quick-commands.md`)
- And more!

# ðŸš€ Why I Made This

I realized that I often look up the same things over and over again. This repo is my way to:
- Keep track of what Iâ€™m learning
- Write things in my own words
- Look back and see how far Iâ€™ve come

## âœ¨ How I Use It

Every time I learn something new, even something small like how to format a list in `.md` or how to reset a Git commit,
I add a short note here. It helps me remember it and reinforces the habit of documentation.
