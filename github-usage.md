# Deleting a GitHub Repository
I have a Repo I don't need (created at the beginning of the account when I didn't know how to use it...)
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Starting 
- Deleting a repository is permanent
- All code, issues, pull request (I have no idea what that is...), and wiki data will be deleted.
- Make sure to back up anything important first!
## üß® How to Delete a GitHub Repository (via the website):
1. Go to https://github.com and log into your account.
2. Open the **repository you want to delete**.
3. Click on the Settings tab
   (‚ö†Ô∏è *This is a tab inside the repo*, not your account settings)
4. Scroll all the way to the **bottom of the Settings** page.
5. Under the **"Danger Zone"**, you‚Äôll see: 
*üóëÔ∏è Delete this repository*
6. Click ‚ÄúDelete this repository‚Äù
7. GitHub will ask you to type the repo‚Äôs full name to confirm (e.g., yourusername/reponame).
8. Click **‚ÄúI understand the consequences, delete this repository‚Äù**

All of this steps make it seam like a big deal. Will be carful from now on ‚úçÔ∏è.

I keep getting a folder for the cache when running code in PyCharm using other txt files so this is the way of ignoring the changes 
each time in the GitHub desktop app. 

# üßæ How to Create a .gitignore File in PyCharm (Step by Step)

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Open Your Project in PyCharm
Make sure you're inside the GitHub project or folder where you want Git to ignore files (like __pycache__/).

## üìù Step 2: Create the .gitignore File
Option A: If it doesn‚Äôt exist yet
1. In the Project view (left panel), right-click on your root project folder.
2. Click New > File.
3. Name the file:

``` .gitignore ```

(Make sure it starts with a dot and has no extension)

4. Click OK or press Enter.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 3: Add ignore rules
1. Once the file is created, PyCharm will open it. Now add lines like:
```
bash

# Ignore Python cache files and folders
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Ignore virtual environments (if you have one)
venv/
env/

# Ignore IDE/project settings (optional)
.idea/
.vscode/
You can write one rule per line.
```

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Save the File
Just press Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac), or PyCharm will auto-save it after a few seconds.

## üßπ Step 5: (Optional) Stop Tracking Existing Files
If you had already committed __pycache__/, Git is still tracking it. You can stop that with:

1. Open PyCharm's terminal at the bottom (Alt + F12 or click the Terminal tab).
2. Run this command:
```
bash

git rm -r --cached __pycache__/
```
Then commit the change:
```
bash

git commit -m "Remove __pycache__ and add .gitignore"
```
