# Deleting a GitHub Repository
I have a Repo I don't need (created at the beginning of the account when I didn't know how to use it...)
## ⚠️ Before Starting 
- Deleting a repository is permanent
- All code, issues, pull request (I have no idea what that is...), and wiki data will be deleted.
- Make sure to back up anything important first!
## 🧨 How to Delete a GitHub Repository (via the website):
1. Go to https://github.com and log into your account.
2. Open the **repository you want to delete**.
3. Click on the Settings tab
   (⚠️ *This is a tab inside the repo*, not your account settings)
4. Scroll all the way to the **bottom of the Settings** page.
5. Under the **"Danger Zone"**, you’ll see: 
*🗑️ Delete this repository*
6. Click “Delete this repository”
7. GitHub will ask you to type the repo’s full name to confirm (e.g., yourusername/reponame).
8. Click **“I understand the consequences, delete this repository”**

All of this steps make it seam like a big deal. Will be carful from now on ✍️.

# How to Commit Only One File in GitHub Desktop
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. In the left sidebar, under the “Changes” tab, you’ll see a list of all files that have been modified.
3. Uncheck the ones you don’t want to include in the current commit:
   - Click the checkboxes to deselect any files you don’t want to commit yet.
   - Leave only the file(s) you want to commit checked ✅
4. At the bottom, write your commit message.
5. Click “Commit to main” (or whatever branch you're on).
6. When you’re ready, click “Push origin” to upload your change to GitHub.com.

I had to Google that because I didn't know...
