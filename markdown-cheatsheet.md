# Headings
Using the `#` symbol to create titles and section headings. It makes them bolder and gives them consistent sizes:

# Big title for headers  
## Section inside the title  
### Subsection

# Numbered Lists
To create numbered lists in Markdown, simply write it like this:

1. First  
2. Second  
3. Third  

Really helpful for making lists and breaking down a text.

*Note:*  
It can be done with any number, and when rendered, it looks as it should (with the appropriate numbers). How cool!

# Bullet Lists
Use `-` to make a list with bullet points:

- One  
- Two  
    - Two.1

---

# Formatting Text
Using asterisks makes it easy to format text:

## One Asterisk
To make text *italic*, wrap the word in a single asterisk (`*`) â€” *like this*

## Two Asterisks
To make text **bold**, wrap it in double asterisks (`**`) â€” **like so**

## Three Asterisks
To make text ***bold and italic***, use triple asterisks (`***`) â€” ***like this!***

# Manual Table of Contents in Markdown (but clickable)
You can make a basic TOC like this:
## ðŸ“š Table of Contents
- [Introduction]("#" Title of the section)
- [Exercise 1]("#" exercise-1)
- [Exercise 2]("#" exercise-2)
- [Reflection]("#" reflection)
ðŸ”— Clicking on any of those links will jump to the matching section in the .md file â€” on GitHub, Phoenix Code, 
- Jupyter notebooks, etc.
