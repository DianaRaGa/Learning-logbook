# Headings
Using the `#` symbol to create titles and section headings. It makes them bolder and gives them consistent sizes:

# Big title for headers  
## Section inside the title  
### Subsection

# Numbered Lists
To create numbered lists in Markdown, simply write it like this:

1. First  
2. Second  
3. Third  

Really helpful for making lists and breaking down a text.

*Note:*  
It can be done with any number, and when rendered, it looks as it should (with the appropriate numbers). How cool!

# Bullet Lists
Use `-` to make a list with bullet points:

- One  
- Two  
    - Two.1

# Formatting Text
Using asterisks makes it easy to format text:

## One Asterisk
To make text *italic*, wrap the word in a single asterisk (`*`) — *like this*

## Two Asterisks
To make text **bold**, wrap it in double asterisks (`**`) — **like so**

## Three Asterisks
To make text ***bold and italic***, use triple asterisks (`***`) — ***like this!***
